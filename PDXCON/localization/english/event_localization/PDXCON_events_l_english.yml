Scripted values are not required to be used. You can define a numerical value like 'remove_short_term_gold = 30'.\n\nTo add martial lifestyle experience, use the command 'add_martial_lifestyle_xp'. I use a variable for the amount, 'miniscule_lifestyle_xp'. The amount of these values are defined in the base game at /common/script_values/00_lifestlye_values.txt\n\nI used the 'first_valid' command here to use 'triggered_desc' to change the event description based on 'has_character_flag'. In this case, I allow the same event to be revisited and the description wil change based on the past option decision the player has chosen.\n\nTo add a trait use the 'add_trait' command. I have defined the trait in /common/traits/00_PDXCON_traits.txt\n\nWhen adding a trait, be sure to increment the 'index' number by one. If two traits share an index number, the game will only use the values defined in one of them. The primary cause of conflict when combining mods is when two different mods use the same index number for a trait.\n\nTrait icons are located at /gfx/interface/icons/traits/ \nThey are in a "dds" format.\n\nBoth options here either remove or add stress to scoped characters. In both cases, the command to add or remove stress is 'add_stress'.  To add stress, use scripted value like 'medium_stress_gain'.  To remove stress, use a scripted value like 'minor_stress_loss'. These values are located in the base game at common/script_values/00_stress_values.txt\n\n"

I will show a more elegant way to do this in the Speakeasy event.\n\nThere is more than one way to do something. For example, there are two different localizations used to show names of characters having a conversation. The first, 'PDXCON_lounge_person_a.GetFullName', shows the full name of a character. The second is a combination of 'PDXCON_lounge_person_b.GetName' and 'PDXCON_lounge_person_b.GetHouse.GetName'. In both cases, the first name and house name is displayed, but the second variation when mousing over the house name shows the house in the tool tip rather than the character."
